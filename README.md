# Lemmy app for YunoHost
**Warning:** This app uses Docker. YunoHost do not encourages to use black box container technologies like Docker and Ansible.

Then why this package uses Docker?
It's because the developers of the core app do not support simple installation. And packaging without documentaion is time consuming.

## Overview
Lemmy is similar to sites like Reddit, Lobste.rs, Raddle, or Hacker News: you subscribe to forums you're interested in, post links and discussions, then vote, and comment on them. Behind the scenes, it is very different; anyone can easily run a server, and all these servers are federated (think email), and connected to the same universe, called the Fediverse.

**Shipped version:** 0.11.0
