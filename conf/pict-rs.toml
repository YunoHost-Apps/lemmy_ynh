timeout = 30

[upgrade]
## Optional: How many hashes will be migrated from the previous version of pict-rs at the same time
# default: 32

## OpenTelemetry configuration
#[tracing.opentelemetry]
## Optional: url for exporting otlp traces
# default: empty
#
# Not specifying opentelemetry_url means no traces will be exported
